# What can you do to help ?
 
# 1. Get informed
• [AI Alignment Course](https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment/1) by Blue Dot Impact

• [Robert Miles Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertMilesAI), AI Safety Researcher

• [The Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/), (fork of the LessWrong forum)

# 2. Talk about it
• Best vulgarization material:

[AI, Humanity's final invention? (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa8k8IQ1_X0) by Kurzgesagt

[What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnT1xgZgkpk) by Nick Bostrom

# 3. Help Alignment Research
• [AI Safety Camp](https://www.aisafety.camp/) research projects

# 4. Provide expertise for governance
• Help make regulations. I don't really know how to do that, but probably the most impactful ..
